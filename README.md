Datastax Astra DB is a fully managed, multi-cloud and serverless DBaaS that scales up and down dynamically with pay-as-you-go pricing.  

Astra DB eliminates operational overhead.  Day 2 operations such as backup and patch will be managed by Datastax.  

It is serverless so it avoids overprovisioning and reduces TCO by matching resources to application requirements and data traffic.  Customers deploy richly interactive modern data apps that can scale infinitely from day 1 and scale down to zero automatically when the database is not in use.

It is available on any of the major public clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) in one or more regions so there is no vendor lock-in. 

Datastax offers free credit of $25/month for trial use.   You will be using this free credit account for this workshop.   With just a few clicks,  you will register to AstraDB.   No credit card information is required.
